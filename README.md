# Super Bomberman 3 Clone

This project is a simple clone inspired by the retro SNES game **Super Bomberman 3**. The repository is created primarily for practice and serves as a showcase for the implementation of single responsibility code.

## Key Features:

1. **Grid-Based Detection:**
   - The project extensively employs a grid-based approach for various game mechanics, enhancing efficiency and simplicity in detection algorithms.

2. **Basic AI Movement:**
   - Demonstrates the implementation of a basic AI movement system.
   - Adapts random movement patterns within the grid layout to simulate dynamic opponent behavior.

3. **Gameplay Features:**
   - Allows players to place multiple bombs strategically.
   - Implements a feature to boost the explosion area.

## Todo:

- [ ] **Player Death on Enemy Collision:**
  - Implement player death when colliding with an enemy to add challenge and consequences.

- [ ] **More Levels:**
  - Expand the game by adding additional levels with increasing difficulty, introducing new challenges and features.

- [ ] **Landing Menu Page:**
  - Create a landing menu page to enhance the overall user experience and provide essential information about the game.


## Purpose of the Repository:

This repository is created as a personal project for skill enhancement, showcasing the application of single responsibility code principles. It's a learning tool and practice ground for game development enthusiasts interested in understanding grid-based systems and basic AI movement.
This project template is designed to be a robust starting ground, providing a foundation that can be extended with additional features.
