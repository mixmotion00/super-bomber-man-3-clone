# Super Bomberman 3 Clone

This project is a simple clone inspired by the retro SNES game **Super Bomberman 3**. The repository is created primarily for practice and serves as a showcase for the implementation of single responsibility code.

## Key Features:

1. **Grid-Based Detection:**
   - The project extensively employs a grid-based approach for various game mechanics and detection algorithms. It was designed this way to respect the original game. 

2. **Basic AI Movement:**
   - Demonstrates the implementation of a basic AI movement system.
   - Adapts random movement patterns within the grid layout to simulate dynamic opponent behavior.

3. **Gameplay Features:**
   - Allows players to place multiple bombs strategically.
   - Implements a feature to boost the explosion area.

4. **Bomb Behaviour:**
   - Explosion destroyed item
   - Explosion kills both player and enemy
   - Collision on both player and enemy, but on placement
  
5. **Chain Explosion:**
   - Multiple bombs explode based on the explosion chain
  
## Input:

- Use arrow keys to move horizontally and vertically
- Use 'E' to place the bomb

## Todo:

- [X] **Player Death on Enemy Collision:**
  - Implement player death when colliding with an enemy.

- [ ] **More Levels:**
  - Expand the game by adding additional levels with increasing difficulty, introducing new reward items and features.

- [ ] **Landing Menu Page:**
  - Create a landing menu page to enhance the overall user experience and provide essential information about the game.

- [ ] **Add Sounds:**
  - Add SFX and BGM into the game.


## Purpose of the Repository:

This repository is created as a personal project for skill enhancement, showcasing the application of single responsibility code principles. It's a learning tool and practice ground for game development enthusiasts interested in understanding grid-based systems and basic AI movement.
This project template is designed to be a robust starting ground, providing a foundation that can be extended with additional features.

### Refactoring Notice:

Certain areas of the codebase may appear messy or experimental, particularly in Unity tile logic. As part of ongoing development, I acknowledge the need for refactoring in these specific areas to improve code quality and maintainability.

### ⚠️ Warning:

Please be aware that this project might contain unforeseen bugs or issues. While efforts are made to create a stable and enjoyable gaming experience, it's important to exercise caution and report any problems you encounter. Your contributions in identifying and fixing potential issues are highly valued.
